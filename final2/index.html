                The region is named after its 11 long, narrow lakes, with Cayuga 
                and Seneca being the largest. These lakes provide opportunities for 
                boating, fishing, kayaking, and swimming. State parks like Watkins Glen, 
                with its stunning gorge and waterfalls, and Letchworth, 
                known as the "Grand Canyon of the East," are must-visit destinations.
