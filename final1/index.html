            <span class="first-sentence">The Finger Lakes region of New York State is a hidden gem, offering 
            a blend of natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant culture.</span> 
            The region is named after its 11 long, narrow lakes, with Cayuga 
            and Seneca being the largest. These lakes provide opportunities for 
            boating, fishing, kayaking, and swimming. State parks like Watkins Glen, 
            with its stunning gorge and waterfalls, and Letchworth, 
            known as the "Grand Canyon of the East," are must-visit destinations.
        </p>

            The Finger Lakes is renowned for its wineries, with over 100 wineries 
            offering tastings and tours, and the region is especially famous for 
            its Riesling wines. Visitors can enjoy farm-to-table dining experiences, 
            local cheeses, and the famous Finger Lakes grape pie. Exploring the 
            charming towns like Skaneateles, Aurora, and Hammondsport, each with 
            its unique history and attractions, adds to the appeal. The region 
            boasts numerous museums, including the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum in 
            Hammondsport.
